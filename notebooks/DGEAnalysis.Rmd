## Background to the project

Manganese (Mn) is a trace element with multiple physiological function mainly 
through emzymatic regulation. for example, Mn is a cofactor of superoxide
dismutase 1 which is mitochondrial based enzyme critical to the reactive oxygen
species control in the mitochondria. 

Mn homeostasis is therefore important for normal physiological function.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
