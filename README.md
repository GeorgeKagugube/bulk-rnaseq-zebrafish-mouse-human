# bulk-rnaseq-zebrafish-mouse-human
End-to-end bulk RNA-seq pipeline from experimental design, RNA sample collection, and analysis pipeline, including raw FASTQ files QC to differential gene expression, GO term, and Pathway analysis.

## Background
The trace element Manganese (Mn) is involved in key biochemical reactions central to normal cellular and systemic function. Like other trace metals, its cellular and systemic concentration is tightly regulated, mainly through dietary absorption and excretion via GI Track and hepatobiliary routes. Mn-driven neurotoxicity is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Mitochondrial dysfunction, disturbed calcium physiology, and oxidative stress are potential pathways involved in Mn overload. 

The influx transporters SLC39A14/8 and efflux SLC30A10 have higher Mn transportation preferences and are central to Mn homeostasis. Using a loss of function mutation of slc39a14-/-
compared to its slc39a14+/+ controls in a zebrafish, Tuschl et al. (2020) recreated Mn overload in the brain reported in clinical settings with a compromised movement disorder typical of Mn overload patients. Studying the response and sensitivity to the Mn challenge of these mutants creates a representative model organism for studying Mn-related neurotoxic mechanisms.  A zebrafish also presents a good model organism given its well-annotated genome, ease of imaging (allowing for a non-invasive look into its brain at single-cell resolution), and high reproductive and growth rates.

**Aim:** To identify the key molecular players and pathways in Mn overload-driven neurotoxicity by leveraging transcriptomics and computational methods. 

The pipelines shared here were used to analyse the transcriptome landscape of slc39a14-/â€”and slc39a14+/+ in exposed compared to unexposed conditions.
